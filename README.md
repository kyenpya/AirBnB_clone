# AirBnB_clone Project

This is the README file for the AirBnB clone project. Below you will find details about the project, the command interpreter, how to start it, how to use it, and some examples.

## Project Description
- The AirBnB clone project is the first step towards building a full web application.
- The goal of this project is to create a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage AirBnB objects. This includes creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

## Command Interpreteir

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

The console willl perform the following tasks:

In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

Starting the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, simply run the console.py script.
```
./console.py
```

### Using the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to interact with the AirBnB objects. The prompt (hbnb) indicates that the command interpreter is ready to receive commands.

### Examples
```
(hbnb) help
```
Displays a list of documented commands.

```
(hbnb) quit
```
Exits the command interpreter.
